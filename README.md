## Some hooks

- useRoute
- useAsync
- usePosts (with query)
- useGiphy (with **masonry grid** and **lazyloading**)
- useReactHookForm (<https://react-hook-form.com/get-started>)
- Implementing some showcases of library **react-use** with some nice hooks.

## Questions

1. If I use the **useDebounce** hook on inputs forms improve performance, but what is the best solution to prevent errors when user digit the text quickly and click on submit button?
